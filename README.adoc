A curated list of links to awesome Qt-related libraries, tools, and other
resources published under Free Software/Open Source licenses.

Don't forget to check http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtmodules.html[the list of essential
and add-on modules from the Qt project] first! Upcoming modules might be in
`qt-labs` or `playground` in http://code.qt.io/[code.qt.io]. And remember that
there is https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp[Awesome C/C++] for more projects
that don't use Qt.

it is cross platform native code that fulfills a common use case of the typical
Qt applications.
